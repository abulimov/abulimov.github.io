Following my [plan](/post/2025/09/18/added-lists) to make this website a better representation of **me** on the Internet,
I've added a [new page listing all my DIY projects](/lists/diy) to date.

[DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) was always close to my heart, it's not terribly far from [my favourite hobby](https://models.bulimov.me), and is something
very physical, grounded in the real world.

All I do at work is purely digital.
At best, it may end up open source, so that other people could see it,
but most will stay proprietary - just a some bits stored on servers I'll never ever see.
And I know from the experience that the code I write today will be rewritten or deprecated sooner or later.

But some of the things I made in my free time, with my own hands, will probably (hopefully) live much longer.

I still use some of my earliest DIY projects, built almost a decade ago.

There is something immensely satisfying in building physical things, even simple ones, and then using them in day to day life.

I also try to [share my designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/abulimov/designs) whenever it makes sense,
and it's great seeing other people build your stuff for themselves.

Anyway, I wanted to categorize and share my tinkering projects for many years now.

**Have a gander at [all the stuff I built](/lists/diy).**

*It ain't much but it's honest work*
