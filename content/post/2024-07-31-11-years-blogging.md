Wow, time flies. Just realized that this blog turned 11 this summer.

`wc -w` tells me that I wrote almost **40k words in 81 posts** over those years, not bad at all.

I managed to post at least once every year since 2013 except for 2019 and 2020 when I was too busy with work.

For me, writing is a very good exercise.
It helps to better shape and express my thoughts, and writing technical things often highlights areas I don’t fully understand.

Sometimes I start a draft note about some topic just to realize that I was wrong about it to begin with, and writing quickly helped to show it.

Of course, writing also helps with my English skills - it’s not my native language,
but I write exclusively in English, including my private journal and notes.

Public posts require more effort and more scrutiny, pushing me harder and making me a better writer.

It's also fun to come back to my old posts and see what I was up to, what I found challenging or interesting.

However, today I made a small change to hide *very* old posts from the main page.

They are still easily discoverable via tags and categories,
but given that they are no longer relevant, I chose not to display them by default.
