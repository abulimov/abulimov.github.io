I recently discovered **Sophie Koonin**'s excellent [personal website](https://localghost.dev/).

Her writing resonates with me quite a bit, especially the latest [This Website is for Humans](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-website-is-for-humans/) entry.

But what prompted me to give more attention to my own personal website is this [love letter to the personal websites](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-page-is-under-construction/).

Her [website](https://localghost.dev/) is definitely a prime example in this category, with beautiful styles and different themes.

Mine is not. At the time of writing, I'm using a slightly customized [xmin theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
not very original I'm afraid.

But that doesn't mean that I don't care, or that I don't want to make this website a representation of **me**.

Anyway, I was admiring Sophie's website, and what grabbed my attention was the [*Uses* section](https://localghost.dev/uses/).

And I thought - Hey, that's right up my alley! I already keep a bunch of lists in [Joplin](/post/2021/05/23/taking-notes/)!

I *love* lists - they help me to almost effortlessly track anything, from things to take with me on a trip, to my video games (including completion status) or books.

And now I'm presenting a curated selection of lists on this website, in the new ['Lists' section](/lists).

Only two lists are now present:
* [video game consoles](/lists/consoles)
* [headphones](/lists/headphones)

It ain't much, but it's an honest work!

**P.S.**

I also began using [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaidchart.com) at work, and liked them very much.

Through playing with them, I discovered that [Gantt diagrams](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/gantt.html) are *just perfect* to visualize timelines.

So on both of the new *lists* I put them to good use.

Ideally I'd rather render the diagrams in SVG during the build phase.
But for now a little bit of JavaScript is not that big a deal on my otherwise completely script-less blog.
