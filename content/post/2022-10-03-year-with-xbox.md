About a year ago [I made a decision](/post/2021/08/07/why-xbox) not to continue with **PlayStation** as my main console, and switch to **Xbox Series** instead. It was a risk, as I have been a reasonably happy PS customer through PS3 and PS4 eras.

Now, after a year with **Xbox Series S** I can sum up my experience and compare notes.

tldr; It is great and I’m very happy with this decision.

I can safely say that all the hopes I put into switching to Xbox have realized!

What worked really well:

* GamePass is great:
   - I discovered some fantastic games like *The Ascent*, *Sable* or *Tinykin* thanks to it
   - Some of first-party titles are great fun, like *Wasteland 3* or *Forza Horizon*
   - Access to full Xbox back-catalogue is really awesome, I already dipped into the classics quite a bit
* Hardware is great - absolutely silent, turns on extremely fast
* Love the controller - good weight, solid build
* Software is also great, haven’t had any issues whatsoever
    - Quick resume is a godsend, I don’t have much time to play, and being able to resume playing the game in under 1 minute is just perfect
    - Smart delivery works seamlessly to update games to current generation
    - Plenty of older titles get automatic 60fps upgrade
* Awesome compatibility with **Xbox360** games, played *Fable*, *Fallout New Vegas* and *Fallout 3* with 1s load time and rock solid 60fps

What could have gone better:

* Some of the classic MS exclusives turned out to be not my cup of tea: didn’t enjoy *Gears of War* or *Halo* for example
* Series S disk is rather small for the big modern games: installing *Halo Collection* along with *Forza Horizon 5* uses pretty much most of the available space
* None of the new MS exclusives that I was looking forward to playing have yet been released

Regardless, it's a great game console and Microsoft surely did learn from the mistakes of Xbox One era. I've sold my PS4 and have no regrets.
