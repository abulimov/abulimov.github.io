Thanks to the fact that I [migrated from Evernote to Joplin](/post/2021/05/23/taking-notes/)
all my notes are now stored in Dropbox as Markdown files.

This allowed me to quickly create a dumb script to extract my scores for each item I reviewed over the years,
and put them in a table.

Now it's all available here on [Reviews](/reviews/) page.

Maybe I'll add the actual mini-reviews as well some day, it's just that it will require more effort from me to
proof-read and clean them up.
