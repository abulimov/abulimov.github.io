I've just published my new site - personal [Scale Models Gallery](//models.bulimov.ru).

[Model making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_building) is my main and favorite hobby, so I've decided to build a whole new site just to write about it.

I just love doing something without the computer, it's an awesome way to de-stress and detox.

Also I love to make notes about things I do, read, watch or play. And one day I've just realized that I want to turn
my notes about making scale models with all this *wip* photos and comments about quality or tools into something bigger.

I've already had great experience with static site generators, so it was just a matter of choosing one.

For reason of being fed up with python at work, and also because I love Go language, I chose [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

It's much easier to set up, it's much faster than [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) I'm still using for this blog,
and it seems to be more flexible.

Once I chose the generator and a [theme](https://github.com/eueung/hugo-casper-two), which is a port of
*Casper* theme from **Ghost** blogging platform, I just had to convert my Evernote notes into a proper site, which I did in a couple of evenings.

I'm pretty happy with the result so far, [models.bulimov.ru](//models.bulimov.ru) looks nice both on desktop and mobile, and does basically
everything I wanted from it, which is just picture-heavy posts and aggregation by tags per scale and make.

I still have to add Google Analytics and Discuss to it, but even now my ego is pretty much satisfied.
