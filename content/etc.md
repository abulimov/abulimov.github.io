# Scale models
I build models for fun, it’s my main and favourite hobby since the 90s.

I set up a nice little gallery of my models, along with build logs, on [models.bulimov.me](https://models.bulimov.me).

# DIY

I love woodworking, but also tinker with electronics, Laser Cutter/Engraver and 3D Printing.

Here you can find [**all the things I made**](/lists/diy).


# Reviews

I'm [writing](/post/2021/05/23/taking-notes/) my mini reviews for games, books and music since 2013, just for fun.
The reviews are not published (yet?), but the [scores are](/reviews).

* [Books](/reviews/books)
* [Music](/reviews/music)

# Lists

Lists are fun, and help me keep things organized.
