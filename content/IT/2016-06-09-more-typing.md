Title: Notes about type systems in popular languages

I've been kind of out of my comfort zone last 3 weeks,
and was trying to use as many new languages and technologies as possible.

I've used C++, JavaScript, React, PHP and [Hack](http://hacklang.org) to name a few,
and I've noticed really cool thing - many popular programming
languages are moving towards mixing best of static and dynamic typing.

* C++ (statically typed language) now has `auto` keyword, specifying that compiler
should deduce type of variable or return type of function automatically;
* JavaScript has [Flow](https://flowtype.org) - static type checker from Facebook,
and there is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) from Microsoft which compiles to JS;
* PHP has type hints since version 5, and they are greatly improved in PHP7;
* [Hack](http://hacklang.org) has even more advanced type annotations than PHP;
* Python added type hints in 3.5, which recently [made me very excited](/it/python-typing).

And it looks like all big companies are using this stuff extensively!
Isn't it awesome? After mainly using [Go](http://golang.org) for last year,
I'm super excited seeng how dynamically typed languages become safer
with type hints, and how C++ brings convenience and ease of dynamic typing to its users.
