<ul>
<li>👌 <strong>Koss Ear Clip KSC75</strong> ❌ (2007-2009).
I wanted a (then legendary) <em>Koss Porta Pro</em>, but didn&rsquo;t have the money. This was the next best thing I could find.
Arguably it was a bad choice for my purposes, since the open nature of the headphones made them impractical to use on the subway.</li>
<li>🧡 <strong>Sennheiser IE4</strong> ❌ (2009-2017).
My first proper choice of headphones, in a sense that I researched the market, read the reviews and selected this particular model.
I was not disappointed, and they served me for years.</li>
<li>👎 <strong>Beyerdynamic Byron BT</strong> ❌ (2018-2022).
Planned as a wireless replacement for IE4, to use while commuting to work.
Sadly I never got to make it fit properly in my ears, regardless of that size tips I used.
They still served me for a good few years, but I never got to love them.</li>
<li>🧡 <strong>Audio Technica ATH-M50</strong> (2013-).
The GOAT! I still use them almost every day.
I replaced the ear pads and put a cover on the headband, but the rest works just fine.
The sound quality is great, significantly better than the noise-cancelling Sony I use for meetings.</li>
<li>👌 <strong>Sony WH-1000XM3</strong> (2018-).
Originally meant as a wireless, noise-cancelling replacement for the ATH-M50, but never fulfilled this promise.
Sadly the audio quality for music is noticeably worse than ATH-M50.
I use them only for Zoom calls at work.</li>
<li>🧡<strong>Sennheiser HD6XX</strong> (2019-).
The real <em>luxury</em> for me. I rarely use them, only when I have the time to properly <em>listen</em> to an album or two.
But when I do, I very much enjoy the sound and the soundstage they provide.</li>
<li>💩<strong>Apple AirPods 3</strong> ❌ (2023-2024).
The plastic abomination which I got for free at work. Hurt my ears, never notified me that they are out of juice - pure overpriced garbage.
In the end I couldn&rsquo;t even successfully unlink them from my Apple account to return, so they went right in the e-waste recycling bin.</li>
<li>👍<strong>SoundCore Liberty 4NC</strong> (2024-).
My go-to headphones for any day to day activity and travels. Noise cancellation works remarkably well, the sound is not bad either.
Very happy with the headphones overall.</li>
