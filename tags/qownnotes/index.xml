      <description>In the days of yore it was common for people to keep a diary. I myself was always a fan of this idea, but could never actually get started with it.
My handwriting is absolutely terrible, to the point that I can&amp;rsquo;t decipher my own notes, which rules out writing diary in an old-fashioned way. And all diary-like mobile apps seem to add too much friction.
I kinda solved this for my needs few years ago by writing an simple app that allows me to quickly collect each day stats and activities in under 1 minute, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the topic of this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it someday later.</description>
