      <description>This site just moved to a new domain bulimov.me. Long overdue move of course, I bought the new domain years ago&amp;hellip;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of static analysis and linting for code.
If a computer can do it automatically - why rely on humans to do the same thing?
That&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&amp;rsquo;m such a big proponent of static typing.
I try to bring linting everywhere:
When I had to deal with huge and complex HAProxy configs - I wrote a linter myself. When later at different place I had to deal with complicated business logic expressed as a state machine - I used Python AST to write a linter for it, and analyze cycles, dead ends and complexity.</description>
