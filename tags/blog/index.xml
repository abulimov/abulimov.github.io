      <description>Now this blog supports Dark Mode, if the browser has it set as preferred.&#xA;I myself switched to using Dark Mode on some of my devices, but only recently noticed that my very own blog didn&amp;rsquo;t have the support for it.&#xA;Thankfully adding it was super easy, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to go much further than this blog&amp;rsquo;s theme Issues on Github.&#xA;The author of this lovely xmin theme provided an answer in the issue #67:</description>

      <description>Wow, time flies. Just realized that this blog turned 11 this summer.&#xA;wc -w tells me that I wrote almost 40k words in 81 posts over those years, not bad at all.&#xA;I managed to post at least once every year since 2013 except for 2019 and 2020 when I was too busy with work.&#xA;For me, writing is a very good exercise. It helps to better shape and express my thoughts, and writing technical things often highlights areas I donâ€™t fully understand.</description>

      <title>Moved to a new domain</title>

      <description>This site just moved to a new domain bulimov.me. Long overdue move of course, I bought the new domain years ago&amp;hellip;&#xA;Anyway, the only interesting bit about this is how I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep the old links alive with a little bit of HTML magic.&#xA;Using a very basic python script I&amp;rsquo;ve created a dedicated Github repo with a directory structure mirroring this site, where each index.html consists of something like this:</description>

      <title>Code-like linting for prose</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of static analysis and linting for code.&#xA;If a computer can do it automatically - why rely on humans to do the same thing?&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&amp;rsquo;m such a big proponent of static typing.&#xA;I try to bring linting everywhere:&#xA;When I had to deal with huge and complex HAProxy configs - I wrote a linter myself. When later at different place I had to deal with complicated business logic expressed as a state machine - I used Python AST to write a linter for it, and analyze cycles, dead ends and complexity.</description>
