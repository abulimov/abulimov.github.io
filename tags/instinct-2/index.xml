      <description>The search for my perfect retro watch face I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying my Garmin Instinct 2 a great deal, but after getting a Casio Royale I yearned to make my Garmin more &amp;lsquo;retro&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;I found a great existing watch face called &amp;ldquo;7 Segments Simple&amp;rdquo; which imitates the look of classic 7-segment displays.&#xA;It was almost perfect for me, except that I wanted to see the current weather right on the watch face.</description>

      <description>It all started when I read a piece from The Verge about a new Casio watch back in July. It described a simple digital watch that only shows time, counts steps and has Bluetooth to export steps data to the phone.&#xA;Now that really caught my attention because I myself was struggling with my Apple Watch for many months (years?) now. The way it negatively affected my mental health and anxiety was clear to me for quite some time, but yet I was not ready to part with the benefits of using it, mainly related to fitness.</description>
