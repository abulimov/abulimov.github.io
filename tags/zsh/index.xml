      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Fish shell as my daily driver for more than 2 years. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to insult Fish - this awesome shell provided me with wonderful out-of-the-box experience, introduced me to autosuggestions, and required almost no configuration.&#xA;But now, after 2 years of heavy usage, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped it in favor of zsh.&#xA;The main reason for the switch is simple - Fish shell is not POSIX-compatible. And while many people keep repeating &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t write shell scripts in Fish, why should you care about POSIX-compatibility?</description>
