      <description>Recently I decided to get out of my shell (pun intended) and check out the latest and greatest in shells, terminal multiplexers and terminal-based text editors.&#xA;After all, It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 years since I took a fresh look at how I use those invaluable CLI tools.&#xA;I still remember how on one of my first jobs I got so engrossed in the work that for a first month or so I completely neglected setting up my work machine, and worked in a stock Debian shell and terminal, which sure looked like a dog&amp;rsquo;s dinner.</description>

      <title>Moving from Fish shell to zsh</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Fish shell as my daily driver for more than 2 years. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to insult Fish - this awesome shell provided me with wonderful out-of-the-box experience, introduced me to autosuggestions, and required almost no configuration.&#xA;But now, after 2 years of heavy usage, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped it in favor of zsh.&#xA;The main reason for the switch is simple - Fish shell is not POSIX-compatible. And while many people keep repeating &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t write shell scripts in Fish, why should you care about POSIX-compatibility?</description>
