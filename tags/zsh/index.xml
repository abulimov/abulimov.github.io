      <description>I spend a lot of time in the terminal.&#xA;I practically live in the terminal at work, that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a given.&#xA;But even this very post is written in Helix, running in Wezterm.&#xA;And it&amp;rsquo;s been like this (and even more so in my SysAdmin days) for close to 20 years.&#xA;I already wrote about refreshing my CLI setup, and how I moved from tmux to Zellij to improve my CLI experience.</description>

      <title>Moving from powerlevel10k to Starship for my zsh prompt</title>

      <description>Last year, when I wrote about refreshing my CLI setup, I explained why I picked powerlevel10k over Starship.&#xA;Starship is a minimal, cross-shell prompt written in Rust.&#xA;Well, things have changed, I re-evaluated my choice and switched to Starship.&#xA;Back in September 2024 I wrote:&#xA;In the case of Starship for example, while the idea of a cross-platform, compiled prompt is interesting, paying the cost of spawning a process (or multiple) each time is just absurd to me.</description>

      <description>Recently I decided to get out of my shell (pun intended) and check out the latest and greatest in shells, terminal multiplexers and terminal-based text editors.&#xA;After all, It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 years since I took a fresh look at how I use those invaluable CLI tools.&#xA;I still remember how on one of my first jobs I got so engrossed in the work that for a first month or so I completely neglected setting up my work machine, and worked in a stock Debian shell and terminal, which sure looked like a dog&amp;rsquo;s dinner.</description>

      <title>Moving from Fish shell to zsh</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Fish shell as my daily driver for more than 2 years. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to insult Fish - this awesome shell provided me with wonderful out-of-the-box experience, introduced me to autosuggestions, and required almost no configuration.&#xA;But now, after 2 years of heavy usage, I&amp;rsquo;ve dropped it in favor of zsh.&#xA;The main reason for the switch is simple - Fish shell is not POSIX-compatible. And while many people keep repeating &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t write shell scripts in Fish, why should you care about POSIX-compatibility?</description>
