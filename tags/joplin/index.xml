      <description>Thanks to the fact that I migrated from Evernote to Joplin all my notes are now stored in Dropbox as Markdown files.&#xA;This allowed me to quickly create a dumb script to extract my scores for each item I reviewed over the years, and put them in a table.&#xA;Now it&amp;rsquo;s all available here on Reviews page.&#xA;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add the actual mini-reviews as well some day, it&amp;rsquo;s just that it will require more effort from me to proof-read and clean them up.</description>

      <description>In the days of yore it was common for people to keep a diary. I myself was always a fan of this idea, but could never actually get started with it.&#xA;My handwriting is absolutely terrible, to the point that I can&amp;rsquo;t decipher my own notes, which rules out writing diary in an old-fashioned way. And all diary-like mobile apps seem to add too much friction.&#xA;I kinda solved this for my needs few years ago by writing an simple app that allows me to quickly collect each day stats and activities in under 1 minute, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the topic of this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it someday later.</description>
