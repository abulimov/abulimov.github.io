      <description>I have been using a robot vacuum cleaner for exactly one year now, so decided to summarize my thoughts.
Generally I’m not a fan of all this &amp;lsquo;smart home&amp;rsquo; stuff, definitely very far from being a fanboy by all standards.
But at the same time I’m a huge fan of automating everything, and thus was always interested in trying a robot vacuum cleaner. If anything, washing machine and a dishwasher already immensely help with other house chores, why not automate cleaning too?</description>
