      <title>Benefits of upgradable laptops</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been concerned by a low amount of memory in my Asus UX310U laptop for quite a long time, but as I used it quite lightly at home, it never became a problem. It has perfectly capable Intel i3-6100U CPU, nice FullHD screen, 5h+ of battery life, so it made no sense to change the laptop just because of RAM.
Obviously 4Gb of RAM is kind of low by modern standards, but when I bought it I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning to use anything resource-heavy like IDE at home, just terminal and browser.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just returned from a vacation, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got quite refreshing experience of using slow internet there.
The thing is, we, as engineers, are used to fast internet, fast development environment, powerful laptops/smartphones, etc.
Unfortunately this is still not the case of a huge part of the world, and it&amp;rsquo;s really important for us to try and walk in their shoes from time to time. And one of my colleagues, being fed up with resource-wise inefficiency of modern software, suggested as a joke to use Raspberry Pi as a dev environment.</description>

      <description>After reading a lot of blog posts about becoming a programmer recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write my own.
It will be a bit different because of two factors:
 I&amp;rsquo;m not a Software Engineer, but a Production Engineer/SRE/Admin; I&amp;rsquo;m from Russia, where CS education is vastly different.  School years School in Russia is 10 or 11 years and you start at the age of ~7 and end it at ~17</description>
