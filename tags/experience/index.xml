      <description>My colleague Balint recently said this, and I absolutely love this mindset.&#xA;Indeed, sometimes you do your best, and it doesn’t work out for the company. Maybe the project is not bringing the money or impact it was supposed to, maybe the business climate had changed. In any case, I’ve seen plenty of projects or even teams and companies that were shut down despite the most earnest and stellar effort from the people involved.</description>

      <title>Benefits of upgradable laptops</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been concerned by a low amount of memory in my Asus UX310U laptop for quite a long time, but as I used it quite lightly at home, it never became a problem. It has perfectly capable Intel i3-6100U CPU, nice FullHD screen, 5h+ of battery life, so it made no sense to change the laptop just because of RAM.&#xA;Obviously 4Gb of RAM is kind of low by modern standards, but when I bought it I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning to use anything resource-heavy like IDE at home, just terminal and browser.</description>

      <title>Refreshing slow internet experience</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just returned from a vacation, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got quite refreshing experience of using slow internet there.&#xA;The thing is, we, as engineers, are used to fast internet, fast development environment, powerful laptops/smartphones, etc.&#xA;Unfortunately this is still not the case of a huge part of the world, and it&amp;rsquo;s really important for us to try and walk in their shoes from time to time. And one of my colleagues, being fed up with resource-wise inefficiency of modern software, suggested as a joke to use Raspberry Pi as a dev environment.</description>

      <title>How I became a programmer</title>

      <description>After reading a lot of blog posts about becoming a programmer recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write my own.&#xA;It will be a bit different because of two factors:&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not a Software Engineer, but a Production Engineer/SRE/Admin; I&amp;rsquo;m from Russia, where CS education is vastly different. School years School in Russia is 10 or 11 years and you start at the age of ~7 and end it at ~17&#xA;As far as I recall, my first programming experience was with LogoWriter in elementary school.</description>
