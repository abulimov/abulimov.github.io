      <description>In the previous post, I mentioned that I prefer to wear &amp;lsquo;dumb&amp;rsquo; watches over the weekend, mainly for reasons related to mental health and hygiene.&#xA;At that moment, my one and only weekend watch remained a wonderful mechanical piece from Hamilton, Khaki Officer Mechanical, with truly old-school ETA6497 movement originating from pocket watches. I had it for over ten years for sure, wore it exclusively for over half of those years.</description>

      <description>It all started when I read a piece from The Verge about a new Casio watch back in July. It described a simple digital watch that only shows time, counts steps and has Bluetooth to export steps data to the phone.&#xA;Now that really caught my attention because I myself was struggling with my Apple Watch for many months (years?) now. The way it negatively affected my mental health and anxiety was clear to me for quite some time, but yet I was not ready to part with the benefits of using it, mainly related to fitness.</description>
