<p><em>I&rsquo;s been awhile since I wrote anything in my blog, mostly because
I was moving to Ireland and was busy at my new job at Big Company™.</em></p>
<p><em>So as I can&rsquo;t write about all the cool technical things we have there,
I&rsquo;ll try to make this blog less tech-savvy and more personal and fun.</em></p>
<p>As a normal IT person I spend whole working day staring at the computer&rsquo;s
screen. While I love my job and all the high-tech stuff, I feel a great demand of
something more physical.</p>
<p>And as a good workout is what my body needs in the end of the day, a good
board game is what my mind needs after work.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-love-playing-board-games">Why do I love playing board games</h2>
<p>Because moving all this lovely meeples, touching wooden components, holding
cards is so satisfying, and so opposite to using computer. It&rsquo;s so REAL, so
MATERIAL. And at the same time playing board games is fun and challenging,
and makes you use your brain in some different way.</p>
<p>Just look at this cute little animeeples from <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119890/agricola-all-creatures-big-and-small">Agricola: All Creatures Big And Small</a>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/animeeples.jpg" alt="animeeples"></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you want to touch them? Looking at them, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how
intense and challenging is this game&rsquo;s mechanic.</p>
<p>And of course playing board games involves contacting with people, which is a
good thing for me.
While most of the time I play board games with my wife, I really enjoy regular
Board Game Nights at the office with my colleagues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to recall when I started playing board games, but I&rsquo;ve been playing
them at least 5 or 6 years, and now have a decent collection
and a clear understanding of what type of games I love.</p>
<h2 id="just-a-quick-overview-of-games-i-enjoy-most">Just a quick overview of games I enjoy most</h2>
<p>For now, my top-3 list is:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119890/agricola-all-creatures-big-and-small">Agricola: All Creatures Big And Small</a></li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne">Carcassonne</a></li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63628/manhattan-project">The Manhattan Project</a></li>
</ol>
<p>All this games I own and play regularly with my wife.</p>
<p>For a big company I prefer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14996/ticket-ride-europe">Ticket To Ride: Europe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146548/imadzhinarium">Имаджинариум</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ekivoki.ru">Экивоки</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, some of them are local Russian games, so I need to find some
equivalents here. Luckily, at Board Game Night I can try many new games for a company.</p>
<p>And I want to mention some old-school card games I love:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cribbage</li>
<li>Rummy</li>
<li>Poker</li>
</ul>
<p>And what&rsquo;s great - there A LOT of board games to choose from, and every year new
games keep arriving. Almost anyone can find a setting he likes with game mechanics
he enjoys. It&rsquo;s so cool compared to my childhood, when most of the board games you
can find you must have to cut from some soviet magazines for kids, and it would
have been some simple &lsquo;roll dice, move forward&rsquo; kind of game. You can take a look
at some of them in <a href="http://www.gamer.ru/boardgames/o-nih-mechtali-vse-deti-sovetskie-nastolnye-igry-70h-90h-godov-foto-obzor">this nice overview (in Russian)</a>.</p>
<p>So if you haven&rsquo;t played board games - give it a try, it&rsquo;s so much fun!</p>
