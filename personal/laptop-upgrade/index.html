<p>I&rsquo;ve been concerned by a low amount of memory in my <strong>Asus UX310U</strong> laptop for quite a long time,
but as I used it quite lightly at home, it never became a problem. It has perfectly capable Intel i3-6100U CPU,
nice FullHD screen, 5h+ of battery life, so it made no sense to change the laptop just because of RAM.</p>
<p>Obviously 4Gb of RAM is kind of low by modern standards, but when I bought it I wasn&rsquo;t planning to use anything resource-heavy like IDE at home, just terminal and browser.</p>
<p>The only case when the lack of RAM was obvious is when the laptop was used by two users. As I share it with my wife,
it was often the case, and switching users was quite painful, but I didn&rsquo;t use it often enough for it to piss me off.</p>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve started to use it more often, for instance to work on latest <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>
coding challenge, and it quickly became a problem.</p>
<p>Luckily for me Asus was generous enough to allow RAM upgrades in UX310U, so I could add up to 8Gb to existing 4Gb that are soldered on the motherboard.</p>
<p>So I bought another 4Gb module, unscrewed the lid and to my surprise not only there was a slot for SODIMM RAM, but also a place for SATA 2.5inch drive.</p>
<p>As I had one spare 128Gb SATA SSD in my stash, just after 10 minutes I ended up with double RAM and double the storage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately now the trend is to just solder everything on the logic board, and don&rsquo;t leave any means for upgrade.
Given that I&rsquo;ve just greatly benefited from ability to upgrade RAM it&rsquo;s very sad to think that
with my next laptop I&rsquo;ll most likely be left without any way to improve it except for buying a new one (like current MacBook users already have to)</p>
