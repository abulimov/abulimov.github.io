<p>I&rsquo;ve just returned from a vacation, and I&rsquo;ve got quite refreshing experience
of using slow internet there.</p>
<p>The thing is, we, as engineers, are used to fast internet, fast development environment, powerful laptops/smartphones, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is still not the case of a huge part of the world,
and it&rsquo;s really important for us to try and walk in their shoes
from time to time. And one of my colleagues, being fed up with resource-wise inefficiency of modern software, suggested as a joke to use Raspberry Pi as a dev environment.</p>
<p>So returning to my experience - I&rsquo;ve been in the Southern Hemisphere,
and tried to access some European and Russian sites. And it was a miserable experience.
Slow and unreliable Wi-Fi + long round-trip made such sites almost unusable,
while Google, Instagram and Facebook were working just fine because of their
Points of Presence close to me.</p>
<p>And in such environment Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">AMP</a> showed itself just perfectly. While being <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/google-amp-not-good-thing">clearly bad from the &lsquo;open internet&rsquo; point of view</a> (and I completely agree with it),
from the &rsquo;normal user&rsquo; point of view it is just what makes his/her favorite sites load fast on bad internet connection.</p>
<p>Because Google caches AMP content and serves it from own servers,
it makes it load from nearest Point of Presence,
and as the content is stripped down to just text + images, it loads instantly, while same non-AMP page takes <strong>minutes</strong> to load.</p>
<p>And this fact makes me think that while anyone can (and should) make their
pages fast, responsive and light, it still won&rsquo;t be as good from user&rsquo;s
perspective, just because it&rsquo;s not feasible for everyone to have caching
POP&rsquo;s close to user.</p>
<p>The page may be just as optimized and lightweight as AMP, but if it&rsquo;s served
from some server that&rsquo;s far from user, Google+AMP will still provide better user
experience, which basically equals being better for user.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amusing how this Google&rsquo;s AMP solution reminds me of 90s
with caching proxy servers (<a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a> anyone?) set up at every ISP.</p>
<h3 id="ps">P.S.</h3>
<p>If you wonder what do people use to actually test their products
on bad internet connection, there are some Open-Source tools to help to simulate whole range of shitty internet issues using <code>tc</code>.</p>
<p>For example, on my previous job I&rsquo;ve used a simple CLI tool called <a href="https://github.com/tylertreat/comcast">&lsquo;comcast&rsquo;</a> with great success
to test how various SmartTVs behave when playing videos from the internet on a bad/slow connection. By the way, with properly encoded videos, they cope with this task really good.</p>
<p>If you need something more advanced, Facebook Open-Sourced <a href="http://facebook.github.io/augmented-traffic-control/">Augmented Traffic Control</a>, which has a nice Web-UI and Thrift API.</p>
