            <p class="note title">A Year With Xbox</p><p class="note date">2022-10-03</p><p class="note content">About a year ago I made a decision not to continue with PlayStation as my main console, and switch to Xbox Series instead. It was a risk, as I have been a reasonably happy PS customer through PS3 and PS4 eras.
Now, after a year with Xbox Series S I can sum up my experience and compare notes.
tldr; It is great and I’m very happy with this decision.
I can safely say that all the hopes I put into switching to Xbox have realized!<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/video-games/">Video Games</a></p></li><li class="item">

Anyway, the only interesting bit about this is how I&rsquo;m trying to keep the old links alive with a little bit of HTML magic.
Using a very basic python script I&rsquo;ve created a dedicated Github repo with a directory structure mirroring this site, where each index.html consists of something like this:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="category" href="/categories/it/">IT</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/blog/">Blog</a></p></li><li class="item">

If a computer can do it automatically - why rely on humans to do the same thing?
That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m such a big proponent of static typing.
I try to bring linting everywhere:
When I had to deal with huge and complex HAProxy configs - I wrote a linter myself. When later at different place I had to deal with complicated business logic expressed as a state machine - I used Python AST to write a linter for it, and analyze cycles, dead ends and complexity.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="category" href="/categories/it/">IT</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/vale/">Vale</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/blog/">Blog</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Why I’m picking Xbox for new generation</p><p class="note date">2021-08-07</p><p class="note content">Disclaimer: this is not an objective comparison, it&rsquo;s my personal, extremely subjective choice.
Here is why I’m not buying PS5, despite having PS3 since 2010 and PS4 since 2014.
And no, it’s not because it too hard to get now :-)
The main reason is simple: For me, PS5 brings no excitement. Now let me explain why.
PS3 to PS4 transition was already kinda boring. I was quite ok with graphics level PS3 provided, and the main improvement that PS4 borough for me was normal digital store (where you don’t have to download patches after you just downloaded full game), and a slightly better controller (albeit with worse battery life).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/video-games/">Video Games</a></p></li><li class="item">

This allowed me to quickly create a dumb script to extract my scores for each item I reviewed over the years, and put them in a table.
Now it&rsquo;s all available here on Reviews page.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll add the actual mini-reviews as well some day, it&rsquo;s just that it will require more effort from me to proof-read and clean them up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/joplin/">Joplin</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Taking Notes</p><p class="note date">2021-05-23</p><p class="note content">In the days of yore it was common for people to keep a diary. I myself was always a fan of this idea, but could never actually get started with it.
My handwriting is absolutely terrible, to the point that I can&rsquo;t decipher my own notes, which rules out writing diary in an old-fashioned way. And all diary-like mobile apps seem to add too much friction.
I kinda solved this for my needs few years ago by writing an simple app that allows me to quickly collect each day stats and activities in under 1 minute, but that&rsquo;s not the topic of this post, I&rsquo;ll write about it someday later.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/evernote/">Evernote</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/qownnotes/">QOwnNotes</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/joplin/">Joplin</a></p></li><li class="item">

It&rsquo;s not too bad, and I can use laptop&rsquo;s keyboard and touchpad for few hours a day without much discomfort, but if I do it for a couple of full working days I get nasty pain in my wrists and fingers.
How it all started Many years ago (I believe it was 2014) when I first started to have those symptoms I did a research which lead me to using Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, helpfully provided by a colleague of mine.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/keyboard/">Keyboard</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/electronics/">Electronics</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/ergodox/">Ergodox</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/helix/">Helix</a></p></li><li class="item">

I&rsquo;ve migrated this blog from Pelican static site generator (written in Python) to Hugo (written in Go).
It by no means reflects on Pelican as a piece of software (it&rsquo;s actually pretty good).

Model making is my main and favorite hobby, so I&rsquo;ve decided to build a whole new site just to write about it.
I just love doing something without the computer, it&rsquo;s an awesome way to de-stress and detox.
Also I love to make notes about things I do, read, watch or play. And one day I&rsquo;ve just realized that I want to turn my notes about making scale models with all this wip photos and comments about quality or tools into something bigger.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/golang/">Golang</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/hugo/">Hugo</a></p></li><li class="item">

It has perfectly capable Intel i3-6100U CPU, nice FullHD screen, 5h+ of battery life, so it made no sense to change the laptop just because of RAM.
Obviously 4Gb of RAM is kind of low by modern standards, but when I bought it I wasn&rsquo;t planning to use anything resource-heavy like IDE at home, just terminal and browser.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/experience/">Experience</a></p></li></ul><div class="pagination">
