<main>
<p>Since I no longer enjoy working with Python in any shape or form, it was only a matter of time (mostly a matter of <em>my free time</em>)
for this to happen. I&rsquo;ve migrated this blog from Pelican static site generator (written in Python) to Hugo (written in Go).</p>
<p>It by no means reflects on Pelican as a piece of software (it&rsquo;s actually pretty good).
It&rsquo;s more about my disdain for Python, and awesome experience I had with Hugo and Go language in general.</p>
<p>One of the reasons this blog was inactive is the fact that setting things up was always too much work in case of Pelican.
Maintaining <code>$PYTHONPATH</code>, dealing with <code>pip3</code> and stuff - meh&hellip;</p>
<p>Blogging should be effortless and fun, but unfortunately for me using Pelican just triggered PTSD.</p>
<p>With Hugo all I need is a single statically built binary that does everything - pretty neat.</p>
<p>Another goal I had for this migration was to make this blog as lightweight and minimalistic as possible.
Very simple theme, no more Disqus, Google Analytics, JavaScript or any other heavyweight stuff.</p>
<p>This whole page is just few kilobytes, and I plan to keep it as lean as possible. Full load of something like &lsquo;medium.com&rsquo; takes 10+ seconds with a good broadband, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s anywhere near acceptable for a predominantly text content.</p>
<p>As much as I admire ReactJS and modern single page webapps, I don&rsquo;t think most of the pages on the Internet should go heavy on it,
and definitely not simple blogs.</p>
