<p>Wow, time flies. Just realized that this blog turned 11 this summer.</p>
<p><code>wc -w</code> tells me that I wrote almost <strong>40k words in 81 posts</strong> over those years, not bad at all.</p>
<p>I managed to post at least once every year since 2013 except for 2019 and 2020 when I was too busy with work.</p>
<p>For me, writing is a very good exercise.
It helps to better shape and express my thoughts, and writing technical things often highlights areas I don’t fully understand.</p>
<p>Sometimes I start a draft note about some topic just to realize that I was wrong about it to begin with, and writing quickly helped to show it.</p>
<p>Of course, writing also helps with my English skills - it’s not my native language,
but I write exclusively in English, including my private journal and notes.</p>
<p>Public posts require more effort and more scrutiny, pushing me harder and making me a better writer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also fun to come back to my old posts and see what I was up to, what I found challenging or interesting.</p>
<p>However, today I made a small change to hide <em>very</em> old posts from the main page.</p>
<p>They are still easily discoverable via tags and categories,
but given that they are no longer relevant, I chose not to display them by default.</p>
