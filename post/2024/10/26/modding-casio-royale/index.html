<p>In the <a href="/post/2024/10/04/dumber-smartwatch/">previous post</a>, I mentioned that I prefer to wear &lsquo;dumb&rsquo; watches over the weekend,
mainly for reasons related to mental health and hygiene.</p>
<p>At that moment, my one and only weekend watch remained a wonderful mechanical piece from Hamilton, <a href="https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-ie/h69619533-khaki-field-officer-mechanical.html"><strong>Khaki Officer Mechanical</strong></a>, with truly old-school <em>ETA6497</em> movement originating from pocket watches.
I had it for over ten years for sure, wore it exclusively for over half of those years.</p>

<p>They work nice as a weekend watch, or a camping watch, or a city break watch - any environment where I don&rsquo;t want to bother with notifications and want to focus on &rsquo;living in the moment&rsquo;.
The only downside, if I can find any, is that they are rather big and heavy, which is not a big deal for me.</p>
<p><strong>So why is the post named &lsquo;Modding my Casio Royale&rsquo; and how did I end up with a second weekend watch?</strong></p>
<p>It all began when I saw a modded <strong>Casio AE1200 &lsquo;NASA Royale&rsquo;</strong> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDv-GFTo87E">this <strong>Adam Savage&rsquo;s Tested</strong> video</a>.
I instantly fell in love with the retro aesthetics, and the fact that it could be easily modded piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Given that the watch costs like a takeaway meal for two (I bought mine for ~40EUR), it was a simple decision to get myself a <strong>Casio AE1200</strong> (commonly known as <strong>Casio Royale</strong> as it resembles the Seiko G757 watch worn by James Bond in one of the movies) and mod it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/casio_ae1200_closeup.jpg" alt="My stock AE1200"></p>
<p>I loved it even in the default form - it&rsquo;s retro, lightweight, and functional (I use the multiple timezone and timer functions all the time).</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to mod it, make it even better!</p>
<p>My modding idea was simple - I wanted a stainless steel case, along with basic de-lettering, all complimented by a leather strap.
AE1200 only comes with a resin case, which in one of the options is plated to look like steel, which is not acceptable to me.</p>
<p>There is an impressive number of mods for AE1200/1300 series, mostly from <a href="https://skxmod.com/">SKXMOD</a>. But I live in Ireland, and they are located in the US, which makes a $100+ steel case even more expensive with the shipping and import taxes.</p>
<p>Solution - AliExpress! Luckily for me, there was a nice stainless steel case with a mineral glass from <strong>Jeraland</strong> for only 30EUR, including shipping and taxes.</p>
<p>Once it arrived, I did the de-lettering myself. Somehow none of the popular solutions (like alcohol or eraser/rubber) worked,
so I resorted to a very fine sanding paper, which made the procedure a bit more involved.</p>
<p>Still nothing complicated, especially compared to the <a href="http://models.bulimov.me">scale modelling</a> I do as a hobby.</p>
<p>Anyway, the result in my opinion looks absolutely superb, and exactly how I wanted.</p>
<p><img src="/images/casio_ae1200_modded_closeup.jpg" alt="Modded AE1200"></p>
<p>I removed the &lsquo;10 year battery&rsquo;, &lsquo;WR100&rsquo; and &lsquo;5 Alarms&rsquo; text from the faceplate, which helps to achieve a minimalistic yet still very retro look.
And with the real stainless steel case and a leather strap, the watch looks much more expensive than it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with the watch and the mod.
It&rsquo;s tailored to my taste and needs, very few people have similar mods, and I did the modifications myself, which adds to the satisfaction.</p>
<p>As a result, now I have a second weekend watch, allowing to choose between more &lsquo;dressier&rsquo; and &lsquo;retro 80s&rsquo; style.</p>
