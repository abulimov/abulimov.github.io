Indeed, sometimes you do your best, and it doesn’t work out for the company. Maybe the project is not bringing the money or impact it was supposed to, maybe the business climate had changed. In any case, I’ve seen plenty of projects or even teams and companies that were shut down despite the most earnest and stellar effort from the people involved.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/it/">IT</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/experience/">Experience</a></p></li><li class="item">

2000 - Humble beginnings Funny enough, my journey to HiFi audio started with no audio. I had a CD-ROM drive in my first PC in 2000, and back then CD-ROM drives had headphone outputs. I used it to play Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd through the cheapest no name earplugs, and was completely floored by it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/hifi/">HiFi</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/audio/">Audio</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">A Year With Xbox</p><p class="note date">2022-10-03</p><p class="note content">About a year ago I made a decision not to continue with PlayStation as my main console, and switch to Xbox Series instead. It was a risk, as I have been a reasonably happy PS customer through PS3 and PS4 eras.
Now, after a year with Xbox Series S I can sum up my experience and compare notes.
tldr; It is great and I’m very happy with this decision.
I can safely say that all the hopes I put into switching to Xbox have realized!<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/video-games/">Video Games</a></p></li><li class="item">

Anyway, the only interesting bit about this is how I&rsquo;m trying to keep the old links alive with a little bit of HTML magic.
Using a very basic python script I&rsquo;ve created a dedicated Github repo with a directory structure mirroring this site, where each index.html consists of something like this:<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="category" href="/categories/it/">IT</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/blog/">Blog</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Code-like linting for prose</p><p class="note date">2022-01-16</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;m a big fan of static analysis and linting for code.
If a computer can do it automatically - why rely on humans to do the same thing?
That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m such a big proponent of static typing.
I try to bring linting everywhere:
When I had to deal with huge and complex HAProxy configs - I wrote a linter myself. When later at different place I had to deal with complicated business logic expressed as a state machine - I used Python AST to write a linter for it, and analyze cycles, dead ends and complexity.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="category" href="/categories/it/">IT</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/vale/">Vale</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/blog/">Blog</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Snooping on unix domain sockets traffic</p><p class="note date">2021-12-02</p><p class="note content">I often work with various binary protocol, with majority of work being implementing those protocols in Go or Rust.
And when dealing with such tasks, I find it extremely useful to be able to snoop on the traffic between existing/reference implementations.
When communication happens over network (even locally), it&rsquo;s easy - just fire up some good old tcpdump and then maybe analyze the dump with Wireshark.
But what if communication happens over the Unix domain sockets?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/it/">IT</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/bpf/">BPF</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/linux/">Linux</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/python/">Python</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Why I’m picking Xbox for new generation</p><p class="note date">2021-08-07</p><p class="note content">Disclaimer: this is not an objective comparison, it&rsquo;s my personal, extremely subjective choice.
Here is why I’m not buying PS5, despite having PS3 since 2010 and PS4 since 2014.
And no, it’s not because it too hard to get now :-)
The main reason is simple: For me, PS5 brings no excitement. Now let me explain why.
PS3 to PS4 transition was already kinda boring. I was quite ok with graphics level PS3 provided, and the main improvement that PS4 borough for me was normal digital store (where you don’t have to download patches after you just downloaded full game), and a slightly better controller (albeit with worse battery life).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/xbox/">Xbox</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/playstation/">PlayStation</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/video-games/">Video Games</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Published all my mini-review scores</p><p class="note date">2021-05-23</p><p class="note content">Thanks to the fact that I migrated from Evernote to Joplin all my notes are now stored in Dropbox as Markdown files.
This allowed me to quickly create a dumb script to extract my scores for each item I reviewed over the years, and put them in a table.
Now it&rsquo;s all available here on Reviews page.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll add the actual mini-reviews as well some day, it&rsquo;s just that it will require more effort from me to proof-read and clean them up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/joplin/">Joplin</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Taking Notes</p><p class="note date">2021-05-23</p><p class="note content">In the days of yore it was common for people to keep a diary. I myself was always a fan of this idea, but could never actually get started with it.
My handwriting is absolutely terrible, to the point that I can&rsquo;t decipher my own notes, which rules out writing diary in an old-fashioned way. And all diary-like mobile apps seem to add too much friction.
I kinda solved this for my needs few years ago by writing an simple app that allows me to quickly collect each day stats and activities in under 1 minute, but that&rsquo;s not the topic of this post, I&rsquo;ll write about it someday later.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/personal/">Personal</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/evernote/">Evernote</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/qownnotes/">QOwnNotes</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/joplin/">Joplin</a></p></li><li class="item">

            <p class="note title">Python is not good for production</p><p class="note date">2021-03-13</p><p class="note content">Here, I said it.
Recently I read an excellent (opinionated) post by rachelbythebay describing things she cannot stand in programming language, and it resonated deeply with me and finally pushed me to write this.
I feel quite strongly about using Python in production, and below I&rsquo;ll summarize my experience and opinion.
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, this is mine.
I&rsquo;m not trying to offend anyone, so if you love Python - maybe try to see my side of things.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/it/">IT</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/python/">Python</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/golang/">Golang</a></p></li></ul><div class="pagination">
