<h1><span class="title">Making a wooden Watch Box with hand tools only</span></h1>

<h2 class="date">2025/01/11</h2>

<main>
<p>I have a very modest watch collection, and my wife also has a couple of watches.
Over the last few years, I <a href="/post/2024/10/04/dumber-smartwatch/">returned to wearing non-smartwatches more and more</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was not happy with my watches lying in the cupboard where we forget about their existence and hence seldom wear them.</p>
<p>In an attempt to solve this, I went ahead and bought the most basic watch box from Amazon for 15GBP.</p>
<p>It did the trick - both me and my wife started to wear our watches more often, admire and enjoy them more. Definitely a positive change.</p>
<p>However, I was not satisfied with the box itself - it was not even made of wood, not even veneered, just a cheap imitation like faux leather of sorts.</p>
<p>I enjoy woodworking quite a bit. Mostly in my <a href="https://models.bulimov.me">modeller&rsquo;s capacity</a>, but I dabble in some real woodworking and wanted to do it more.</p>
<p>Because the things I do professionally are all in the digital world, I find great pleasure and satisfaction in working with my hands, preferably with hand tools only.</p>
<p>Adding two and two, I found myself with a perfect beginner woodworker project on my hands.</p>
<p>The goal I set for myself was to simply <strong>make a <em>box</em> re-using the existing fixtures, have some fun and get real woodworking experience.</strong></p>
<p>Since I already had a functional watch box, I could simply take measurements of the required individual slots for the cushioned watches.</p>
<p>With those measurements on hand, I went to the local hardware store (Woodie&rsquo;s), and bought pine strip wood of the appropriate dimensions (in my case, 11 mm x 90 mm x 900 mm).
Without any power tools, ripping and planing my own planks would be impractical, and that pine wood was already &lsquo;squared&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, real life intervened, and the wood waited a couple of months until I found the time and energy for such a project.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I had a few days of PTO lined up after Christmas, and even managed to use some of them for woodworking.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>I really wanted to practice the real joinery, so decided to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovetail_joint">dovetails</a> in the design of this box.</p>
<p>Thanks to the excellent &ldquo;Collins Complete Woodworker&rsquo;s Manual&rdquo; book, I knew exactly which tools I needed and how to make the dovetails.</p>
<p>Of course, first I practised by making test joints, which turned out acceptable, giving me some confidence in the feasibility of the task.</p>
<p>After that, it was a matter of carefully measuring and cutting the dovetails.</p>
<p>I used a Japanese pull saw and chisels for this task. Nothing too difficult, just requires a good measurement and a steady hand.</p>
<p>Lesson learned - never do cuts when tired. I had to re-do one side of the box three times, simply because I was already exhausted and kept making stupid mistakes.</p>
<p>That entire exercise - making a dovetail-joined box out of existing squared stock - took me an entire day.</p>
<p><img src="/images/watch_box_wip_01.jpg" alt="dovetails"></p>
<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<p>Next step was making the grooves for the floor piece and the glass.
And here I hit a snag! I didn&rsquo;t have a specialized plane for this, nor did I have any power tools like a router or a table saw to help with this task.</p>
<p>More so - I didn&rsquo;t even have the chisel narrow enough to clean the grooves, either. I needed 2 mm and 3 mm grooves, and my smallest chisel was 6 mm.</p>
<p>So I had to improvise - cut the sides of the groove with a knife, then &ldquo;excavate&rdquo; the middle with a whittling knife.
Very tedious and laborious, but it worked, and I managed to make the grooves in this manner, spending a full day on this task.</p>
<p>Lesson learned - ordered some smaller chisels.</p>
<p><img src="/images/watch_box_wip_03.jpg" alt="grooves"></p>
<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<p>Next task was preparing the floor pieces and the plexiglass pieces.</p>
<p>Cutting the 2 mm plywood for the floor was super easy, used a metal ruler and a knife to score it a few times - done.</p>
<p>Cutting the 3 mm acrylic sheet with a coping saw was more challenging, but still doable. Used a coping saw for the task.</p>
<p>Cutting and fitting plus making the inner section of the box with 4 grooves took me another full day.</p>
<h2 id="day-4">Day 4</h2>
<p>Another day I spent preparing everything for the glue up.</p>
<p>Simply making sure everything fits together fine, and deepening the grooves where needed, took a while.</p>
<p>Assembled everything one least time and glued the joints with a PVA glue.</p>
<p><img src="/images/watch_box_wip_02.jpg" alt="box assembled"></p>
<h2 id="day-5">Day 5</h2>
<p>The next day I split the box into the lid and the bottom, and it was rather challenging.
Required a steady hand, and at the same time it is a long cut, so my hand got pretty tired by the end of it.
Used a Japanese pull saw again.</p>
<p>The cut turned out pretty well, and required very little planing afterwards.</p>
<p>Still, I got to play with my Faithfull block plane, very pleased with it.</p>
<p>I also took the fixtures off the old cheap box, and cut the slots for the hinges in the new box.
Not hard at all, just slow, methodical work. Took me a couple of hours to do it.</p>
<p>In the evening, I tested various wood stains on a scrap piece of pine, to see how the finished product would look like.
After presenting the test piece to my wife, we both picked &lsquo;Medium Georgian Oak&rsquo; stain colour, I love this colour and used it before on various DIY projects.</p>
<p><img src="/images/watch_box_wip_04.jpg" alt="box cut"></p>
<h2 id="day-6">Day 6</h2>
<p>Next task was cleaning all the dovetails, removing the protruding parts and sanding the whole box.
No surprises, just a lot of elbow grease required for this type of work.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to make the inserts to separate the box into smaller sections for each watch.</p>
<p>I used 2 mm basswood plywood, cut it by hand using a utility knife and a metal ruler.
Again, nothing difficult about it, simply taking measurements and making lots of cuts.</p>
<p>It worked a charm, and placing it inside the box finally gave it a finished look, quite satisfying.</p>
<h2 id="day-7">Day 7</h2>
<p>This day I only applied two coats of Danish oil.</p>
<p>I realized and confirmed with the experiment that I couldn&rsquo;t stain the box in the assembled state.</p>
<p>Because I already had the plexiglass inserted in the grooves, I couldn&rsquo;t apply the stain there.
The inner part of the groove remains visible, since the plexiglass is fully transparent.
Have I stained the box, this inside of the groove would stand out as a lighter, unstained wood.</p>
<p>The experiment clearly demonstrated that it looked pretty bad indeed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I ended up only applying the oil finish.</p>
<h2 id="day-8">Day 8</h2>
<p>On the final day, I lightly sanded the box with a 400 grit sandpaper, and applied another coat of Danish oil.</p>
<p>Once it dried, I added the fixtures which only took a few minutes, and called the box completed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/watch_box_finished_01.jpg" alt="complete"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fun project overall. Had great time woodworking in 1:1 scale, used new tools, made a real watch box.
Sure, it&rsquo;s far from perfect, but I made it myself. Not too bad for a first real woodworking project.</p>
<p>At the very least, I&rsquo;m using it, and the fact that it&rsquo;s real wood and I made it myself makes me happy.</p>
<p><em>P.S.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely impressed by just how challenging and time-consuming making a simple wooden box turned out.</p>
<p>Eight days spent on it in total, and at least five of them were pretty much a full day of work.</p>
<p>Of course, part of the reason for this was my lack of experience, and part was my deliberate decision to only use hand tools.</p>
<p>But still, it really put into perspective just how much the methods and tools brought by the Industrial Revolution changed the manufacturing process and the world in general.</p>
