<h1 id="the-search-for-my-perfect-retro-watch-face">The search for my perfect retro watch face</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying my <a href="/post/2024/10/04/dumber-smartwatch/">Garmin Instinct 2</a> a great deal, but after getting a <a href="/post/2024/10/26/modding-casio-royale/">Casio Royale</a> I yearned to make my Garmin more &lsquo;retro&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I found a great existing watch face called <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/apps/b7f055a4-9098-41ed-8c54-92e992a31139">&ldquo;7 Segments Simple&rdquo;</a> which imitates the look of classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display">7-segment displays</a>.</p>
<p>It was <em>almost</em> perfect for me, except that I wanted to see the current weather right on the watch face.</p>
<p>Since I found no source code repo for this watch face to contribute this feature, I decided to play with Garmin&rsquo;s <strong>Connect IQ SDK</strong> and build my own, similar watch face.</p>
<p>After all, the API seemed very simple, and customizing my watch by coding is right up my alley.</p>
<p><em>Tangent: rant about Apple Watch</em></p>
<p>Speaking of customizing a smartwatch&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the things I really found lacking with the Apple Watch was being able to fully customize it.</p>
<p>Just to make it clear, there are a couple of really serious obstacles to building <em>anything</em> for iPhone/Apple Watch:</p>
<ul>
<li>one needs a macOS system to build any mobile app (hate this limitation with passion).</li>
<li>in order to get a dev licence that allows publishing apps, one needs to pay the greedy multi-billion company 99 USD per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are annoying enough for me already&hellip;</p>
<p>But the main answer to the question of &ldquo;why I didn&rsquo;t create a custom Apple Watch face?&rdquo; is even simpler:
Apple forbids creating fully custom watch faces, and even goes as far as banning any app looking like a watch face from the App Store.</p>
<p>Very developer-friendly and not annoying at all&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Rant end</em></p>
<h2 id="development-process">Development process</h2>
<p>It took me only couple of hours to get familiar with the SDK, the API and Garmin&rsquo;s extension for VS Code.</p>
<p>The SDK comes with a watch emulator, so testing the code is as streamlined as it gets.
Really quick iteration cycles, when building and testing a watch face only takes few seconds.</p>
<p>The language Garmin uses is called <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/">Monkey C</a>, and it is a C-like duck-typed language that is compiled into byte code.
Nothing special, but it&rsquo;s good enough for the task at hand.</p>
<p>Instead of painting the segments as polygons (my original plan), I found a beautiful font called <a href="https://www.keshikan.net/fonts-e.html">DSEG</a>.
Garmin watches support using custom fonts, which allowed me to simply write any text styled as a 7-segment or 14-segment display on the watch screen.</p>
<p>It proved to be a great approach, and allowed me to build the first prototype in one hour.</p>
<p>From there it was simply a matter of migrating to &ldquo;layouts&rdquo; (XML files describing the elements, customized for each physical screen size) to add support for different watch models (normal and small versions of Instinct 2 for now), and the first version of the app was ready.</p>
<p>By the way, side loading it into my watch was as simple as copy-pasting it over USB.</p>
<h3 id="refreshing-every-second">Refreshing every second</h3>
<p>The only tricky part in the whole watch face development process was dealing with the partial display updates to enable seconds &rsquo;ticking&rsquo; while the watch is in energy efficient state.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the trick is <a href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-faq/how-do-i-get-my-watch-face-to-update-every-second/">well documented</a> and basically boils down to defining a <code>onPartialUpdate</code> function and inside it setting the screen clipping to only update the seconds area.</p>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>I used my new watch face for a good few days before encountering a crash.</p>
<p>Debugging proved very easy - the crash log (with a full stack trace, if the app was built in a development mode) is stored on the watch, and accessing it is again done over the USB.</p>
<p>Turns out, I didn&rsquo;t handle the fact that the weather could be &rsquo;null&rsquo; in some cases, duh.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-the-app">Publishing the app</h2>
<p>Publishing my watch face was rather simple too. Use one command in VS Code, upload the file into a web form, wait for the review, and <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/apps/516e843d-6d26-4f48-9760-3d01989872c6">that&rsquo;s it</a>.</p>
<p>No need to have a specific proprietary OS. No fees. And there is even an input field for the app source code repo!</p>
<p>Did I mention that my watch face is fully <a href="https://github.com/abulimov/garmin-watchface-retrosimple">open-source</a>?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of open-source, it was only logical to make the watch face open under the MIT licence. If anything, it might be useful for someone to copy-paste some code in their own custom watch face.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That was a fun little project. I&rsquo;m quite happy with the outcome, and use my custom watch face exclusively.</p>
<p>Was the time investment (which I estimate around 4-5 hours) worth it? To me, the answer is a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, since I got to tailor my watch experience exactly to my current needs.</p>
