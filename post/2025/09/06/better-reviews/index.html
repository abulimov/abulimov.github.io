<h1><span class="title">Revamped reviews section + a little retrospective</span></h1>

<h2 id="better-reviews-section">Better reviews section</h2>
<p>When I added the <a href="/reviews">reviews</a> section <a href="post/2021/05/23/my-reviews/">back in 2021</a>,
it was somewhat readable, if a bit messy.</p>
<p>Four years after, with the addition of 4 * 3 new tables (one per year per category),
it became completely unusable.</p>
<p>Thankfully the content of that page was always generated programmatically, so all it took
to make it better was a bit of Python followed by re-generation of the page.</p>
<p>Main change is that I split each categeory (<a href="/reviews/video-games/">Video Games</a>, <a href="/reviews/music/">Music</a> and <a href="/reviews/books/">Books</a> into a
dedicated page, and turned the information for the particular year into a separate table.</p>
<p>This alone made it so much easier to navigate this information dump.</p>
<p>And the cherry on top was adding a set of years on top, each linking to the corresponding
table within the page.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>
<p>Now that I can finally comfortably navigate the reviews section, I gave it a fresh look, which prompted me for a little retrospective.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Now, Music section is hard to evaluate - for me it is too personal and heavily depends on the mood, so I just accept the scores, knowing that that&rsquo;s how I felt at the time of writing.
Very rarely I re-evaluate them - sometimes an album of a band I follow comes out and doesn&rsquo;t match my mood completely.</p>
<p>Latest example would be <strong>Kanawha Black</strong> by <strong>Nechochwen</strong>. When it came out, I couldn&rsquo;t get into this album at all, despite loving their previous albums.</p>
<p>Few years later I give it another try, and like it very much. Back then I&rsquo;d rate it a 6, now it&rsquo;s a 9 for me.
But I never down-rate the albums, only up-rate them. Again, it is all too mood-sensitive.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>For books - I have terrible memory for the books I read, so I simply cannot re-think my scores, I just take them at a face value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious I&rsquo;m really into the Tall Ships, but I didn&rsquo;t need to re-visit the reviews section to know this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also rather clear that my favourite contemporary fiction author is <strong>N. K. Jemisin</strong>. The worldbuilding in her books is simply outstanding.
I was extremely skeptical when I learned that each book of the The Broken Earth trilogy took a Hugo award.
After reading the first one, I was extremely impressed and bought the second one. Aftering the second one, I bought the rest of her books.
So far, none of them disappointed me in the slightest.</p>
<h3 id="video-games">Video Games</h3>
<p>For video games I think I can do something of a proper retrospective.</p>
<p>Let us focus on the higlights first.
Those are the games I either keep playing, or at least keep thinking about from time to time, meaning they left a big mark on me.</p>
<h4 id="shadowrun-trilogy">Shadowrun trilogy</h4>
<p>Such a fascinating world, with great ideas. Good enough gameplay too, but the world itself and the world building are outstanding.
I still often think of it, and the stories told in the games. Especially Qi and the Kowloon Walled City&hellip;
It&rsquo;s a shame only 3 modern games in that series were made.</p>
<h4 id="planescape-torment">Planescape Torment</h4>
<p>&lsquo;What can change the nature of a man?&rsquo;. One of the stories that will stay with me forever.</p>
<h4 id="wasteland-2--3">Wasteland 2 &amp; 3</h4>
<p>Surprisingly great games, especially the plot and the choices we make, and a fantastic comeback for Brian Fargo of Fallout fame.</p>
<h4 id="assassins-creed-games">Assassins Creed games</h4>
<p>Have to admit, I like them a lot, they are like comfort food for me.
Even the hated Valhalla got a 9 from me.</p>
<h4 id="snowrunner">Snowrunner</h4>
<p>One of my top games of all times, and the only game where I bought 4 season passes.
I love driving trucks through mud and restoring the infrastrucutre. Played hundreds of hours in this game, and will probably play hundreds more.</p>
<h4 id="fallout-1--2">Fallout 1 &amp; 2</h4>
<p>Formative games for me, I keep coming back to them every few years, and replaying them just for fun.</p>
<h4 id="fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</h4>
<p>Desperately needs a remake, but even in the current state it shows what modern Fallout games could be.</p>
<h4 id="elex-greedfall-the-technomancer">Elex, Greedfall, The Technomancer</h4>
<p>Janky RPGs that reminded me what I love about role playing games.
Elex in particular made me realize just how shallow Skyrim and most of the modern RPGs are. Now I need to re-play Gothic 1 &amp; 2 which I loved back in the days.</p>
<h4 id="chained-echoes-shadows-of-adam-ara-fell-rise-of-the-third-power-cosmic-star-heroine">Chained Echoes, Shadows of Adam, Ara Fell, Rise of the Third Power, Cosmic Star Heroine</h4>
<p>Modern indie takes on the 16-bit era JRPGs, which I never played.
I really love them, and even sponsored Quartet (the next game from the creators of Shadows of Adam) on Kickstarter.</p>
<h4 id="the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild--tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &amp; Tears of the Kingdom</h4>
<p>Truly standout games, where exploration is king. Just a joy to play.</p>
<h4 id="return-of-the-obra-dinn--the-case-of-the-golden-idol">Return of the Obra Dinn &amp; The Case of the Golden Idol</h4>
<p>Never expected to like this type of games, but ended up falling in love with them.
In turn it started my journey into the world of deduction games, from Chants of Sennaa to Sherlock Holmes games.</p>
<h4 id="lunistice">Lunistice</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good with platformers, never played them as a kid, have no nostalgic feelings whatsoever.
But this game is pure concentrated joy! I absolutely loved it, even more than Super Mario Odyssey.</p>
<h4 id="tinykin">Tinykin</h4>
<p>Similar to Lunistice, it&rsquo;s a pure joy to play. It is one of very few games which made me stay up late to keep playing.</p>
<h4 id="yokuss-island-express">Yokus’s Island Express</h4>
<p>Same category as Lunistice and Tinykin. Absolute joy to play.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It is no surprise that there are plenty of RPGs in the highlights - after all, it&rsquo;s my favourite genre.
What does surpsise me a little is that most of the games here are either indie or made by smaller studios.</p>
<p>Out of the whole list of highlights only Assassin&rsquo;s Creed series and The Legend of Zelda games are what is considered AAA tier.</p>
<p>And what truly amazed me is games like Tinykin and Lunistice. Pure joy to play, better than even Nintendo&rsquo;s first party titles.
So good that even someone very much partial to the genre like me found them impossible to put down.</p>
