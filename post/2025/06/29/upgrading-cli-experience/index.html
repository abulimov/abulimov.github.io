<main>
<p>I spend <em>a lot of time</em> in the terminal.</p>
<p>Obviously, I practically live in the terminal at work, that&rsquo;s kind of a given.</p>
<p>But even this very post is written in <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix</a>, running in <a href="https://wezterm.org/">Wezterm</a>.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been like this (and even more so in my SysAdmin days) for close to 20 years.</p>
<p>I already wrote about <a href="/post/2024/09/22/refreshing-cli-setup/">refreshing my CLI setup</a>,
and how I <a href="/post/2025/03/22/tmux-zellij/">moved from tmux to Zellij</a> to improve my CLI experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now time to talk about small tools that make a big difference.</p>
<p>A full disclaimer - as a true SysAdmin, I thought all of them to be of little value, something superficial,
something that a hipster, with a MacBook, would use while drinking pumpkin latte in a café somewhere in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to admit that I was wrong.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s start with the basics!</p>
<h2 id="bathttpsgithubcomsharkdpbat"><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a></h2>
<p>I never thought I needed a better version of <code>cat</code> until I tried it.
Makes a huge difference thanks to the line numbers, syntax highlighting and pagination.</p>
<p>Even more useful to use for file previews, for example in conjunction with <code>fzf</code> (more about it later).</p>
<p>I aliased <code>cat</code> to <code>bat</code> long time ago, never regretted this decision.</p>
<p>Although I still often pipe things to <code>less</code> out of habit, I realize that have I tried <em>bat</em> earlier in my life I&rsquo;d probably just <code>cat</code> everything now.</p>
<h2 id="ezahttpsgithubcomeza-communityeza"><a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza">eza</a></h2>
<p><code>eza</code> is a modern <code>ls</code> and <code>tree</code> alternative with colours and icons.</p>
<p>Just as with <code>bat</code>, I aliased <code>ls</code> and <code>tree</code> to <code>eza</code> and never looked back.</p>
<p>Colorful, legible <code>ls</code> output makes my life in the terminal much more pleasant.
And given the fact that I never got used to the actual CLI file managers, I still rely on <code>ls</code> very often.</p>
<h2 id="ripgrephttpsgithubcomburntsushiripgrep"><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a></h2>
<p>This one is has nothing to do with the nice colourful output.</p>
<p><code>rg</code> is a much faster modern <code>grep</code>, with saner flags as a bonus. I think it&rsquo;s an absolute no-brainer to switch to it.</p>
<p>Really, I can&rsquo;t believe I did not give it a try years ago.</p>
<p>I search inside big files (we are talking multiple gigabytes big) very often at work, so it hurts to think just how much time I wasted waiting for <code>grep</code> to finish!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think it is a small thing - sure, finding stuff takes one or two seconds instead of 30 - not a big deal.
But in fact because it is so fast, it doesn&rsquo;t interrupt the flow (you don&rsquo;t need to context switch or zone out while waiting for the results),
so it makes a massive impact on the overall productivity.</p>
<h2 id="fdhttpsgithubcomsharkdpfd"><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a better version of <code>find</code>.</p>
<p>Granted, I don&rsquo;t use it too often (neither did I use <code>find</code> often),
but it&rsquo;s frequently used by other tools and even editor plugins for picking files,
so doesn&rsquo;t hurt having it installed.</p>
<p>And unlike <code>find</code>, flag names make sense.</p>
<h2 id="fzfhttpsgithubcomjunegunnfzf"><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a></h2>
<p>This tool alone deserves a dedicated post, and luckily there are plenty written about already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable how much can be built with it to enhance the CLI experience.</p>
<p>I use it for several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>fuzzy file selection with <code>zsh</code>, with the excelled <code>**</code>+<code>Tab</code> shortcut. Absolute must for anyone using <code>zsh</code>.</li>
<li>fuzzy history search with <code>zsh</code>.</li>
<li>custom file picker with content preview.
At work, we have a tool to search the big monorepo content, think <code>grep</code> but distributed and over a very large repo.
With <code>fzf</code> + <code>bat</code> I can use it while having a nice syntax-highlighted preview of the file, down to the exact position inside the file.
Massive improvement to my workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning this amazing tool, but the examples you can find on the internet are absolutely mad.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Discovering tools like these is precious to me, and the improvements they made in my experience is what
drives me to continue the experimentation and search for better tools.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I discovered and eventually <a href="/post/2025/03/22/tmux-zellij/">migrated to Zellij</a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wrote this post in <code>helix</code> and not <code>vim</code>.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s paramount to keep experimenting, trying new tools, even if your setup already seems fine.</p>
<p>I also admit that it can be very hard to find the energy or mental capacity to do it,
especially when facing time and performance pressure at work.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may take months or even years for me to dedicate a bit of resources for the experimentation,
but every time I do it I&rsquo;m rewarded with some meaningful discovery, and it keeps me motivated to <em>try</em> and find the time to continue doing this.</p>
