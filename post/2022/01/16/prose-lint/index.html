<main>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of static analysis and linting for code.</p>
<p>If a computer can do it automatically - why rely on humans to do the same thing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m such a big proponent of static typing.</p>
<p>I try to bring linting everywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I had to deal with huge and complex
HAProxy configs  - I <a href="https://github.com/abulimov/HAProxy-lint">wrote a linter</a> myself.</li>
<li>When later at different place I had to deal with complicated business logic expressed
as a state machine - I used Python AST to write a linter for it, and analyze cycles, dead ends and complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course I use existing open-source linters whenever possible.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was intrigued when I read about <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale"><code>Vale</code></a>
in recent issue of excellent <a href="https://golangweekly.com/issues/394">Golang Weekly newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of bringing code-like linting to prose definitely sounds very appealing,
and the tool being syntax-aware and written in Go added to the excitement.</p>
<p>I tried it with both of my blogs (first the <a href="https://models.bulimov.ru/">Scale Models</a>, then this)
and with some configuration tweaking it&rsquo;s just what I need!</p>
<p>It works just as it should - tons of independent lint rules, with flexible configuration.
And the fact that it is syntax aware is great - no weird issues just because I&rsquo;m using Markdown.</p>
<p>Static text-based config and rule sets are designed to be a <a href="https://github.com/abulimov/abulimov.github.io">part of the repo</a>,
which makes it so natural to enable advanced auto checks that don&rsquo;t depend on the environment.
I totally see why <code>Vale</code> is already used by so many big projects to lint documentation,
and I didn&rsquo;t even start to write custom rules.</p>
<p>You may wonder why I was happy to see it written in Go? Because it promises <em>speed</em>!
I&rsquo;d be equally happy to see Rust or C/C++ there. And that&rsquo;s because I had already experimented with
Python-based <a href="https://github.com/amperser/proselint/"><code>proselint</code></a> some time ago, and it&rsquo;s just so slow&hellip;</p>
<p>Just some numbers to contemplate: running <code>proselint</code> on all posts in this blog takes crazy <strong>50 seconds.</strong>
<code>Vale</code> has more checks (including all of the <code>proselint</code> rules), but running it on the same content takes mere <strong>1.5 seconds</strong>.
Why does it matter? Because I wanted it to be a part of pre-push checks, and also integrate in my text editor,
and fast tool make all the difference to one&rsquo;s productivity.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;m really glad I started to use <code>Vale</code>, and honestly a bit embarrassed that I didn&rsquo;t think about
something like this before, given my long standing love for linting.</p>
